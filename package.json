  "description": "Write a piece of code that scrapes the website for qualified candidates in Georgia and returns a list of those candidates, for an election happening on a specified date. Details: 1. The function should accept an optional parameter of an election date. 2. The function should visit this website: https://elections.sos.ga.gov/GAElection/CandidateDetails 3. It should pull up the candidate list for the election date given, or the most recent election date if none was given. 4. It should take these candidates / races and turn them into a JSON object. You do not have to do any standardization or cleaning of the data fields. 5. This JSON object should be returned by the function. 6. The final JSON object should be an array of races. Each race should have a subfield of candidates, which is an array of candidates who have qualified for that race. Notes: 1. The code should be written in Node.js, unless you have a good reason to write it in another language. 2. For web scraping, we use this library: https://playwright.dev/. It is fast, lightweight, and has a good developer experience. You do not have to use this library, but it might be a good starting point. 3. The code should be a function, not a rest API. The function can always be wrapped in an API if needed. 4. The final code should be a polished, working product. Iâ€™ll be looking at readability, so be sure to name variables well and include comments where necessary.",
